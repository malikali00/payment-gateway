## Editing the Site Template without deployment

2. Edit the files:
```
web/view/theme/spg/assets/spg-theme.css
web/view/theme/spg/assets/spg-theme.js
```
Note: Mobile Template is activated by replacing 
```layout-horizontal```
with 
```layout-vertical```
and happens automatically when the page is loaded based on client information

3. Commit & Push

$ git add .;
$ git commit -m "Site Theme Changes";
$ git push;
```
